# Note
The notes of Seiburg-witten and symTFT are written in June, they are summaries about what I learnt in PMQFTSS held in Umass University.
The N=1 SYM quantization is my recent work about N=1 guage theory, and I'm still polishing it. See its sections 4&5 for something new, and all suggestions are welcome.
